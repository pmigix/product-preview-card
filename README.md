## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Imagining each item as a box has helped me understand how flex containers and flex items work making it easier for me to construct the layout.

### Continued development

Work on understanding when, why and how max/min-width/height properties should be used. Also, positioning images properly - avoiding overflows and hard-coding values.
